Welcome to CRUX's documentation!
================================

CRUX is a tool for analysing somatic cancer datasets at the cohort level.

Crux can be used to

#. Identify Candidate Cancer Drivers
#. Compare Genomics of Two Cohorts of Cancer
#. Examine Cohort-Level Patterns in Mutational Signatures
#. Investigate how clinical metadata are associated with cancer genomics

See **Using CRUX** for how to perform these analyses.

This documentation is a work in progress.
